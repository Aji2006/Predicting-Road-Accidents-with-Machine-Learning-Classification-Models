# Predicting Road Accidents with Machine Learning Classification Models


## About This Project
This project aims to develop a road accident prediction model using machine learning classification techniques. The goal is to predict whether an accident is likely to occur based on various features such as weather conditions, road type, time of day, and traffic density.

## Project Motivation
Iam currently learning machine learning and data analysis, and this project serves as a practical exercise to understand how classification algorithms work. By working on this project, I aim to improve my skills in:

- Data preprocessing

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Feature engineering

- Model building and evaluation
